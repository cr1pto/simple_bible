## Building the project

### Prerequisites

- You need flutter to build this app.  Download it here: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install?gclid=Cj0KCQjwj7CZBhDHARIsAPPWv3e9dUqtof6PAihBeTejkeBN8VtmisQom4m0FzsSjP2Hxznl0fWmH9QaAo0YEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds

Below is what I have on my machine for what is currently used to build the application.  
- Flutter: 3.0.2
- Java Zulu JDK (open java jdk): 17.0.1
- Python: 3.9.7
- Dart: 2.17.3
- Ruby: 2.6.8p205

I use Android Studio to run my builds. I have been using a couple of Android Pixel emulators as well as an iPhone 

If you have some trouble getting this to run, drop an issue on the repo.
